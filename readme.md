This repo is dedicated for Git Practice.

The main purpose of this repo was to observe if the remote origin's URL us automatically added to config file if we clone the repo from GitHub to Git.

And , yes it did.

I did not have to explicitly add the remote origin URL via GIT bash.

I noticed this in the class and hence wanted to try it out myself.

I am glad I did it and with no hiccups whatsoever.

So, If we clone a remote repo to git via "git clone" command, we need not add the remote repo's URL explicitly.

I learned this today. This was new to me.
